\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction} 
Every day new technologies are available on the market making the realization of advanced robotics applications easier and accessible to large public. This is leading to a spread of a  number of different approaches to typical problems casing many redundant implementations of relatively common problems.\\
This thesis investigates a flexible and scalable approach to the development of software for robotics, trying to maximize the potentiality of the underlying components while abstracting the complexity of the low-level implementation. The idea of a component-based software framework is not new: among others we recall Orocos, Open-RTM, ROS, OPRoS and SmartSoft.\\

Details on this work will be explained in the details in this thesis but the sources of the software everything necessary to reproduce the results can be found in git repositories.
